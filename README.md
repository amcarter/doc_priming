# DOC priming experiments
2022 July
FLBS internship Project

Project summary: 
Incubation experiments using river water and rock biofilms to determine how priming with labile carbon and nutrients affects the breakdown of recalcitrant organic matter. 

Code includes:
- processing raw data from Picarro to determine dissolved CO2 concentrations
- analysis of incubation experiments to determine priming effects
